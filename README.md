# Adobe Settings
Here i have uploaded all the settings & preferences I used on daily basis with Adobe Apps. These settings will improve your workflow and might make you efficient in your work. Additionally, there are some panels that we required on daily basis and so this are placed in screenshots so you can duplicate my own settings on your Adobe software.

They are segeregated into different folders to keep them organize and you can use this settings as per your need, dupluicate and own the settings howvever you like!

TY :)
